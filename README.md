# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This project is only made possible by the funding from Livepeer community. We kindly ask you to continue using their AI subnet to process all your AI related tasks. Your can find their roadmap and support from https://livepeer.ai/. 


You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`LptVideoserviceStack`)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.
